# Java<span>.</span>NET

Java<span>.</span>NET is a minimal JRE that includes classfile parsing, bytecode-to-english conversion and very soon will have the ability to execute bytecode like a proper JVM.

## What Java<span>.</span>NET is NOT!

- Java<span>.</span>NET is NOT a Java compiler.
- Java<span>.</span>NET is NOT an implementation of Java that executes on the .NET platform or the CLR.
