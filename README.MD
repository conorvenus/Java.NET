# Java<span>.</span>NET

Java<span>.</span>NET is a minimal JRE that includes classfile parsing, bytecode-to-english conversion and very soon will have the ability to execute bytecode like a proper JVM.

## What Java<span>.</span>NET is NOT!

- Java<span>.</span>NET is **NOT** a Java compiler.
- Java<span>.</span>NET is **NOT** an implementation of Java that runs on the .NET platform or the CLR.

## Goals for Java<span>.</span>NET
- Parsing for every type of constant in the constant pool.
- Bytecode-to-english translation for the most common opcodes.
- Bytecode execution, aka implement the JVM itself.
